    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        South Africa is a country on the southernmost tip of the African continent, marked by several distinct
        ecosystems. Inland safari destination Kruger National Park is populated by big game. The Western Cape offers
        beaches, lush winelands around Stellenbosch and Paarl, craggy cliffs at the Cape of Good Hope, forest and
        lagoons along the Garden Route, and the city of Cape Town, beneath flat-topped Table Mountain
